# oldfk (old flake, a story)

my old flake.

this is my old flake.

this is the old flake because i have a new flake.

my new flake has a name.

it's called nivea.

its latin for snowy.

also its new and niv sounds like new.

you can find it [here](https://github.com/aemogie/nivea)

but this is the old flake.

eventhough i still use it.

that's because the new flake is empty.

im rewriting everything from scratch for the new flake.

but while i do

i use this one

dont expect good code here.

i always write good code, except when i dont.
